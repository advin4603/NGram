war of rights is a multiplayer game set during the perilous days of the american civil war in the maryland campaign of september 1862
campfire games is devoted to presenting the gruesome and glorious elements of the period while maintaining the highest level of historical accuracy and realism as is possible with the wonders of cryengine
take part in engagements consisting of 300 players
custom formation buff mechanic system rewards sticking together by lessening the suppression effects the morale cost for the team when dying and the flag bearer respawn rate
fall in on the line as an infantryman or shatter the fighting spirit of the enemy as an artillery crewman
more than 30 historically accurate skirmish areas of the battles of antietam and south mountain as well as the siege of harpers ferry to play on and three drill camps to perfect your formation forming abilities or simply exchange battle stories at the campfire
powered by cryengine v war of rights is capable of providing visuals unmatched by any other civil war game
war of rights is a vision that keeps expanding its scale
the project is entirely crowdfunded and has been developed on for the past 6 years
we consider it more of an ever evolving artistic piece rather than a final product with a targeted release deadline with set features
will you heed the union call against the traitors
or will you fight to defend your family and livelihood with the confederacy
you decide
the order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead
some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates
this will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game
an alpha is never without its bugs
new content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up
the battles of south mountain and shepherdstown will eventually complete the maryland campaign of 1862
besides the quicker skirmish mode the largest and main game mode intended for the game known as historical battles would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas
this will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of generals using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield
the chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals
generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode helping to bring some order to the chaos of war
horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units moving artillery pieces as well as for the high command and their couriers
the cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war
once the above features have been finished we will be at the point that we would be just about ready for full release of the game to all and sundry
this final release would also be the point that those that had backed us originally would be getting their promised physical and digital goods
while we cannot give any definite date as to when we might get to release we inch closer every day
please note this game is currently in alpha
some features and visuals do not represent the final look and feel of the game
please see the discussion board for planned upcoming features and suggestions

lone fungus is a true metroidvania set in a world built by mushrooms where you play as the last mushroom alive
explore an ancient world acquire new abilities and discover secrets
in the early access version as of now there are 8 unique areas you can explore each area consists of enemies and obstacles distinctive to that area
there are plenty of secrets to be found and you will truly be rewarded for exploring every corner in each area
the game always rewards player exploration with meaningful upgrades in terms of relics emblems health or mindpoints upgrades which will prove very useful to any player
read more about what these are in the combat section
the combat in lone fungus is simplistic but has depth in terms of customization
you can for instance parry anything that would normally would damage you but parrying incoming projectiles in particular will shoot them back at foes
you are however never forced to parry and you can even change how the parry system works by equipping emblems
emblems are items you will find all over the world
equipping an emblem might change how the parried projectile behaves for instance you can make it home into enemies but deal less damage
or instead of bounce a projectile off your cap you will do damage to anything near you
there is even a vortex emblem which destroys multiple projectiles around the player
and then there are permanent upgrades which you gain from fighting bosses these are all from spells to new moves and types of attacks
lone fungus currently features 21 bosses you can fight and gain new powers by beating them
my aim is to create fun and fair boss fights that technically always are possible to win without taking any hits from the boss
i do this by giving the bosses memorable patterns and clear telegraphs in their attacks
i also try to stay away from too much randomization in their attacks
my aim is to create fun and challenging bosses where when you know how to fight them then you should be able to beat them every time
lone fungus is a precision platformer at heart however it never forces you to do any very challenging platforming in order to progress in the game

however if you do want to delve deep into the games hardcore mechanics the game does offer practice rooms where you can fine tune your skills and take on the hardest platforming challenges the game has to offer
play the game how you want

we were tired of the polished details in other games and decided to try creating a game with a different visual look
when we talk about space we imagine beautiful only built spaceships and if we take it and say that the parts from which these ships were assembled lay for many years and were destroyed
it is this mood that we tried to convey with our visual style
the actions of the game take place on the system in which the colonization ship was sent on board which there were only autonomous machines
they were supposed to prepare the planet for the arrival of people but no one flew to them
we are also planning to add a map with planets so that you can explore them on your aircraft build space stations and whatever your imagination wants
our game has a system of logical connections through which you can create amazing mechanisms and machines
working cars tanks catapults conveyor belts walking creatures or minimalist structures that use only gravity

we created the game deliberately like this as we wanted the game to be purely investigatory driven by the player
any information you find and extract is solely thanks to your own imagination of asking questions and interrogating her
we also wanted this game to be a social cooperative experience
for example you might play this game for while and then challenge or compare your findings with a friend
did you both figure out the same information
maybe you both unraveled two different key information and if you piece them together you both now understand the bigger picture
seeing that there is no clear end to this game we encourage cooperative and information exchanging among friends as well as on other discussion forums and platforms

it was not until humans became overrun with greed and an insatiable need for power that the humans began the gratuitous killing of animals beyond what they needed for food and survival
angered by the humans actions the creator separated the two populations assigning them their own respective villages and different languages
as a punishment for their ignorance the humans and animals were then completely segregated and the ability to communicate was lost
although the balance between the humans and animals was in peril the creator passed a piece of his primal essence to a few select kind and honest humans which allowed them to still understand the animals and to yield the power of the 11 spirit animals by taking on their animal forms
as the creator was bestowing the gift of the spirit animal to the few select humans elsewhere dark and malevolent energy manifested
the dark lord saw this schism between animal and man as an opportunity to overrule the world with his darkness and evil
to accomplish his evil goals the dark lord gathered the most corrupt of the humans and promised them the power of their own to rule the world if they were to supply him with both animal and human sacrifices to feed this insatiable hunger for fear and pain of all living creatures
even if these girls are outrageously gorgeous they are so well known for the very reason that nobody could ever manage to conquer them
